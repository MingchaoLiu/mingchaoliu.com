We are interested in the mechanics of slender structures and their applications in robotic metamaterials with innovative functions, which can be referred to as ''Mechanorobotics''. These functions include programmable robotic behaviors such as shape-morphing, mechanical sensing, actuation, memory, and computation, as well as tunable mechanical properties such as stress-strain relations, energy absorption, and vibration isolation. Our aim is to design and analyze these types of intelligent systems by harnessing mechanics theory, numerical simulations, and physical experiments.

The Principal Investigator
======
Dr. [Mingchao Liu](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/engineering/mechanical-engineering/people/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=205089) (刘明超) is currently an Assistant Professor at [University of Birmingham](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). Before move to Birmingham, he was a [Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/research/research-careers/presidential-postdoctoral-fellowship-(ppf)) at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore from 2022 to 2023, and a [Newton International Fellow](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/) at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, sponsored by the Royal Society from 2018 to 2022. He graduated from Tsinghua University in 2018 with a PhD in Engineering from the Department of Engineering Mechanics. During his Ph.D study, he spent six months in 2017 as a visiting research fellow at the University of Sydney under the support of the Endeavour Research Fellowship. Prior to this, He received his B.S. in Engineering Mechanics from Shandong University in 2013.
