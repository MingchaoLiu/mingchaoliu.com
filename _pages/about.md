The Adaptive & Intelligent Matter (AIM) Lab explores how materials, structures, and mechanics can be harnessed to create systems that adapt, morph, and exhibit physical intelligence. By integrating nonlinear mechanics, metamaterial design, and soft robotics, we seek fundamental principles that enable mechanical intelligence—where adaptation and decision-making arise from the intrinsic dynamics of matter rather than from digital control. Our research spans multistable morphing structures, bio-inspired soft machines, and AI-driven inverse design of robotic systems. Through the convergence of solid mechanics, applied mathematics, and robotic materials, the AIM Lab advances adaptive and intelligent matter—structures capable of sensing, learning, and evolving with their environments.

The Principal Investigator
======
Dr. [Mingchao Liu](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/mechanical/liu-mingchao) (刘明超) is currently an Assistant Professor at [University of Birmingham](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). Before move to Birmingham, he was a [Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/research/research-careers/presidential-postdoctoral-fellowship-(ppf)) at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore from 2022 to 2023, and a [Newton International Fellow](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/) at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, sponsored by the Royal Society from 2018 to 2022. He graduated from Tsinghua University in 2018 with a PhD in Engineering from the Department of Engineering Mechanics. During his Ph.D study, he spent six months in 2017 as a visiting research fellow at the University of Sydney under the support of the Endeavour Research Fellowship. Prior to this, He received his B.S. in Engineering Mechanics from Shandong University in 2013.
