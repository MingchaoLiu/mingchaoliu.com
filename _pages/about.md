We work at the intersection of mechanics, materials, and robotics, with the overarching goal of creating adaptive robotic systems that are intelligent by design—structures that can sense, respond, and reconfigure autonomously without relying on complex electronics or traditional control algorithms. By integrating nonlinear mechanics with AI-driven design methodologies, we aim to establish the foundations for a new class of adaptive robotic matter: soft machines and metamaterials that harness structural logic, mechanical instabilities, and environmental stimuli to achieve multifunctional performance.

The Principal Investigator
======
Dr. [Mingchao Liu](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/engineering/mechanical-engineering/people/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=205089) (刘明超) is currently an Assistant Professor at [University of Birmingham](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). Before move to Birmingham, he was a [Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/research/research-careers/presidential-postdoctoral-fellowship-(ppf)) at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore from 2022 to 2023, and a [Newton International Fellow](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/) at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, sponsored by the Royal Society from 2018 to 2022. He graduated from Tsinghua University in 2018 with a PhD in Engineering from the Department of Engineering Mechanics. During his Ph.D study, he spent six months in 2017 as a visiting research fellow at the University of Sydney under the support of the Endeavour Research Fellowship. Prior to this, He received his B.S. in Engineering Mechanics from Shandong University in 2013.
